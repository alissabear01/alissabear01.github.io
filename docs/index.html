    <p>Hello! I’m Alissa, a freelance artist and game developer based in California. I’m currently pursuing a B.A. in Art and B.S. in Computer Science, where I’m refining both my creative and technical skills. Through my studies and freelance work, I’m developing my skills in animation, illustration, and coding to bring imaginative worlds to life.</p>
